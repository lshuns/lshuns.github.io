I am a PhD student interested in the [gravitational lensing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), from its measurements to its applications in other astronomical studies. My current research focuses on systematics and applications of weak lensing measurements. For that, I participate in the [Kilo-Degree Survey](https://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) (KiDS) as a core member of the calibration team and the *galaxies and halos* working group. Specifically, I am building multi-band image simulations for shear and redshift calibration ([Li et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221007163L/abstract)). I also conducted an internal-consistency test for the KiDS weak lensing data ([Li et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...646A.175L/abstract)). From the science aspect, I am working on cosmic shear analysis for constraining cosmological parameters (Li et al. in prep.) and galaxy-galaxy lensing effect for studying dark matter and its influence on galaxy groups (Li et al. in prep.). 

Before my research leaned toward weak lensing and cosmology, I also had experience with gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (e.g. [Li et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2220L/abstract)) and data analysis of microlensing events (e.g. [Li et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.3308L/abstract)), which still fascinate me.
