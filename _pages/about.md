I am currently studying at [Leiden Observatory](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy) as a PhD student whose research interests revolve around the [gravitational lensing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), from its measurement to its application in other astronomical studies. I have experience with the gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (e.g. [Li et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2220L/abstract)) and the data analysis of microlensing events (e.g. [Li et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.3308L/abstract)). Albeit still fascinated by these topics, my current research leans toward the weak lensing effect, including how we can robustly measure this subtle effect (e.g. Li et al. in prep.) and how it can help us explore the Universe (e.g. Li et al. in prep.).
