I am a KIPAC Rubin Fellow at the [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I received my PhD from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en) on October 25, 2023, with a thesis titled [Cosmic tomography with weak gravitational lensing](https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/3645974). Before that, I earned an MSc in Astrophysics from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and a BSc in Astronomy from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). 

<!-- Prior to moving to the Bay Area, I held short postdoctoral positions at the [Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille](https://www.lam.fr/en/) and the [German Centre for Cosmological Lensing](https://gccl-rub.github.io/) at Ruhr-Universität Bochum.   -->

My research focuses on using the [gravitational lensing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), to study dark matter, galaxies, and the large-scale structure of the universe. I am part of international collaborations including the [Kilo-Degree Survey](https://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) and the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/).

<!-- My research interests cover the wide spectrum of [gravitational lensing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), including microlensing, strong lensing, and weak lensing. Currently, my work focuses on weak lensing measurements and their applications to probing dark matter and refining cosmological models. I am a core member of the [Kilo-Degree Survey](https://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/), where I contribute to cosmic shear analyses (e.g. [Li et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...646A.175L/abstract); [Li et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...670A.100L/abstract); [Li et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...679A.133L/abstract)) and explore galaxy–halo connections through galaxy–galaxy lensing ([Li et al. 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...700A.202L/abstract)). I am also an active member of the [*Euclid* Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/)’s weak lensing science working group, where I coordinate the key project on internal consistency checks for DR1 cosmology with weak-lensing two-point statistics, and contribute to shear calibration and cosmic-ray masking for VIS imaging.   -->

<!-- Earlier in my career, I studied gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (e.g. [Li et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2220L/abstract)) and carried out data analysis of microlensing events (e.g. [Li et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.3308L/abstract))—areas that still capture my curiosity today.
