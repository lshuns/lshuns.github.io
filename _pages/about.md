I am currently a PhD candidate at [Leiden Observatory](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy) in the Netherlands. Prior to this, I earned an MSc in Astrophysics from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.nao.cas.cn/) in 2019, and a BSc in Astronomy from [Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/) in 2016. My research interests encompass a broad spectrum of [gravitational lensing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), including microlensing, strong lensing, and weak lensing.

My current research primarily focuses on weak lensing measurements and their applications in the study of dark matter properties and the refinement of cosmological models. I am a core member of the [Kilo-Degree Survey](https://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/), contributing to cosmic shear analysis (e.g. [Li et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...646A.175L/abstract); [Li et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...670A.100L/abstract); [Li el al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230611124L/abstract)) and exploring applications of galaxy-galaxy lensing (Li et al. in prep.). Furthermore, I am a member of the weak lensing science working group within the [*Euclid* Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/), where my contributions include validating cosmic shear performance and the Flagship simulations. 

Before pivoting my research focus towards weak lensing and cosmology, I accumulated experience in the gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (e.g. [Li et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2220L/abstract)) and in the data analysis of microlensing events (e.g. [Li et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.3308L/abstract)), areas that continue to captivate my interest.
